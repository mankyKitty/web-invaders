Web Invaders
================

Feeble shmup. My first PureScript game for [onegameamonth.com](http://onegameamonth.com).

In theory, you should be able to just clone the repo and open the `index.html`, that will run the game.

I'm aware so much is missing, but in the spirit of One Game a Month, I'm calling it done. :)

....... Maybe.

Instructions:
-------------

Arrow Keys to move.
Space to shoot.

You lose if any escape past you.

Art Credits:
---------------

You rock, thanks!
